## Instructions

For the final task you are given four variables:

- `machineActive` — contains an indicator of whether the login machine is switched on or not (`true`/`false`).

- `pwd` — Contains the user's login password.

- `machineResult` — begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel, letting the user know whether the machine is switched on.

- `pwdResult` — begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel, letting the user know whether their login attempt was successful.

<br>

We'd like you to create an `if...else` structure that checks whether the machine is switched on and puts a message into the `machineResult` variable telling the user whether it is on or off.

<br>

If the machine is on, we also want a second conditional to run that checks whether the `pwd` is equal to `cheese`.

- If so, it should assign a string to `pwdResult` telling the user they logged in successfully. 
- If not, it should assign a different string to `pwdResult` telling the user their login attempt was not successful. We'd like you to do this in a single line, using something that isn't an `if...else` structure.
